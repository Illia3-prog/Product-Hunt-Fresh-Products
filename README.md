# Product Hunt Fresh Products

I made a tool that automatically collects new products from Product Hunt and saves them to a products.csv file that can be opened in Google Sheets or Excel. It helps you see what products are launching right now without manually browsing Product Hunt every day.

What’s included:
product name
short description (if available)
product link
launch date

Who this is useful for:
startup founders & entrepreneurs — to find ideas
investors — to track fresh launches
developers — to stay aware of new tools
anyone who wants to understand what’s being released right now

If you want early access, custom filters, or a private version — feel free to DM me.
